# Aurora GoNZooo

I was getting a bit tired of switching between themes that were all almost satisfactory,
so I decided to pick one that I liked the base of and go from there.

The result is this theme. It's mostly made to make PureScript look decent for now, though it was
originally made for Elixir and I use it for many other languages.
